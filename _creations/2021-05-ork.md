"There is no colud, just someone else's computer."

You know the saying, right? 
However, the vast majority of us does not care at all where our data ends up, or even who can see it.
Everyday peoples' everyday questions are these, like:
* Who can have access to my entire banking data?
* Who can read my private emails?
* Who can see my drunken-naked pictures at an illegal sexparty? :-D

I would say, I am just a bit more concerned on these issues than the vast majority, but it was enough to set out the goal to make my own internet server, alongsige with my own database.
The first step was the server, and this month I created that:
* I was lucky enough to get a not so old machine.
* I installed Kali (Linux) on it. (Kali is fine for me, so quit your whining and move on.) :-)
* A very basic firewall.
* Then an Apache2 server.
* I made my changes in the config files.
* It still did not work like I wanted as I did not have an IPv4 address, but I called my provider that I need one, and in seconds they managed to give me one without any further questions.
* I set up the router to be able to handle a server. (e.g. port, and so...)

And it worked! :-D
